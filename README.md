# tdd_exercises

This repository contains:

1. decimal-Roman-kata.js - code to transform a decimal to a Roman numeral, and vice versa
2. decimal-Roman-kata.test.js - tests to test the above code
3. mp4 video - embarassing clip of me trying to apply test-driven development principles
4. a document with logic that describes the kata algorithm
5. some package dependency-related files


It should be possible to run the code and its associated test script locally by cloning this repository and installing its dependencies:

npm install

The jest tests can then be run from the terminal:

npm test decimal-Roman-kata.test.js
